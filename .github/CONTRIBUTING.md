## Validation Rules
Validation rules should be `final` and `readonly`. The message returned by a validation rule should not include ending
punctuation.

### Best Practices
1. __Use of `final` and `readonly`__: Ensure that validation rules are declared as final and readonly whenever possible. This practice promotes immutability and prevents inadvertent changes to the validation logic.
2. __Error Message Formatting__:
    - __Avoid Ending Punctuation__: When crafting error messages for validation rules, refrain from including ending punctuation such as periods, exclamation marks, or question marks. This helps in maintaining a uniform style and prevents inconsistency in error message presentation.

__:white_check_mark: Good Example__
> Value should be a valid email address

__:x: Bad Example__
> Value should be a valid email address!
